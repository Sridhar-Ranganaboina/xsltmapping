Build Product Components:

**Bitbucket Utility:**
- **Objective:** Enhance Bitbucket Utility into an enterprise application capable of supporting all deployment requirements for UIPATH bots (Attended, Unattended, tech team developed bots, business team developed bots).
- **Approach:**
  - Strategically plan to rearchitect the solution for easy and quick adaptation to frequent changes.
  - Establish infrastructure (VSI or AWS) for Bitbucket Utility to seamlessly handle user requests.
  - Deliver the tool to a wider audience across the firm.
  - Expand functionality to support Power Automate Deployments.

**CI/CD:**
- **Current State:** Currently utilizing VSI Jules pattern build for deploying UIPath bots. Muting the actual deployment stage in the pattern build, a custom stage has been created for bot deployments.
- **Action Plan:**
  - Schedule a call with the Jules team for a comprehensive review of the current approach. Revamp the design based on their inputs.
  - Redesign CI/CD to accommodate Power Automate Bots.
  - Integrate a feature for deploying reusable components.

**Inventa Snippo/Visual Document Understanding Process:**
- **Objective:** Enhance Inventa Snippo with the following features using Chat GPT or Gemini AI LLM models:
  1. Export information from a scanned image or a scanned PDF on the fly, enabling business teams to utilize it seamlessly.
  2. Export information from a scanned image or a scanned PDF as Swagger APIs, providing Tech teams with accessible APIs for applications or bots.
  3. Generate dashboards or charts for analysis from scanned sources.

**Bitbucket to Github Migration:**
- **Objective:** Enhance Bitbucket Utility and CI/CD pipeline to support Bitbucket to Github migration.

**Master Merge Tool:**
- **Proposal:** Develop a master merge utility to automatically merge release branches into master post-deployment and completion of testing.

**WinAutomation to UiPath Migration Tool:**
- **Initiative:** Respond to requests to demonstrate the WinAutomation to UiPath Migrator utility. Explore opportunities to enhance its usability as a component.
