I'm not only intrigued by Gemini AI but also keenly interested in exploring various AI/ML use cases. Our recent hackathon submission focused on OCR-free Visual Document Understanding, planning to leverage Donut and Hugging Face Encoder-Decoder transformers. However, amidst our progress, Google unveiled Gemini, which I tested with the prompt "Convert given image to JSON with inner context." The results were promising, extending its capability to handle PDFs, Word, Excel, etc., by splitting them into images based on page numbers. In my personal lab, I found it not only efficient but also providing prediction percentages. Although we currently use desktop tools like Inventa Snippo and Process Discovery Tool for content extraction, the limitation with Snippo lies in producing only raw text without structured formats like JSON or XML.
