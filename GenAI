### Abstract for the Generative AI Studio Hackathon Idea

**Title: Generative AI Studio: An Integrated Platform for Custom AI Model Deployment**

**Abstract:**
The Generative AI Studio is an innovative platform designed to simplify the process of deploying and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for various applications. This platform allows users to seamlessly integrate diverse data sources, select from a range of LLMs (such as OpenAI, Gemini AI, LLaMA, and other open-source models), and customize system behaviors through templates. Users can choose to perform embeddings or vectorizations with their preferred models and store the resulting vectors in databases like Chroma. The platform supports different training methods, including one-shot and few-shot training, and provides flexible output formats like chat or completion styles. Upon successful model configuration and testing, the Generative AI Studio offers deployment options on GCP or AWS EKS as FastAPI endpoints, ensuring scalability and robust performance for real-world applications.
