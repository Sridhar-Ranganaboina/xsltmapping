Thank you for reaching out to me regarding the usage and adaptation of our patented idea, "he Inspace (The System and Method for implementing an attended automation module"- Child Session with in the user  allows you to run attended processes in an isolated Windows session without interrupting your current work." I'm pleased to share with you the exciting developments since our patent submission.

After the successful patent submission, we wasted no time in implementing a Proof of Concept (POC) to demonstrate the practical application and benefits of InSpace. The innovation team quickly put together a POC to showcase the capabilities of this technology in real-world scenarios.

One of the notable developments is our collaboration with the Internal UiPath Team. They approached us with a specific challenge related to their PiP (Picture in Picture) issue. Recognizing the potential of the InSpace idea, we were eager to assist them. We successfully showcased the POC to the UiPath Team, demonstrating how our patented concept could be adapted to solve their PiP issue effectively.

I'm thrilled to inform you that our collaboration with the UiPath Team has yielded remarkable results. By implementing the InSpace idea, we were able to provide a practical solution to their PiP issue, greatly improving their user experience and efficiency in handling PiP-related tasks. This successful adaptation underscores the versatility and value of our patented concept in addressing real-world challenges.
